# Gladiator


## What is it?
Gladiator is a Java application using Binary Trees to simulate fights between gladiators.

In this project, my primary goal was to design and create logic behind	
the Gladiator Tournament simulator. The main focus is on the object-oriented approach	
and the separation of concerns.
